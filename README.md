=========

Very simple substitution encryption cracker using quadgram's to analyze the text.

It seems to work as long as the text is long.

It takes to command line argument:
First argument is a text file to "learn" a language from.  Project Gutenberg is a good start to find these text files.

Second argument is the filename of text file containing the encrypted text.  

During cracking it will show you a status with best key and first 200 characters of the best solution until then.

The program runs until ctrl-c is pressed.
